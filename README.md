My submission for assignment 5.

## Analysis
* Students who attend charter schools as opposed to district schools do significantly better on standardized tests. Not only are the top five performing schools charter schools and the bottom five performing schools district schools, the overall percentage of students who passed both reading and math is almost 40% higher at charter schools than their district counterparts on average.
* Schools who have a smaller per student budget tend to have higher scores. This is evident in the "scores by school spending" section. As school spending increases, student scores decrease.
* Although small and medium schools have similar performance, students who attend larger schools perform worse on average with a decreased passing rate 30% less than their smaller counterparts.

## Overview
In this project, we will analyze data from a new pharmaceutical company's most recent animal study. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the company's drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

* Generate summary statistics
* Create bar charts displaying the number of timepoints of all mice tested for each drug regimen throughout the course of the study.
* Create pie charts displaying the distribution of male and female mice
* Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create box plots displaying the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin
* Create a line plot displaying tumor volume vs. timepoint for one of the mice that was treated with Capomulin
* Create a scatter plot showing tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen
* Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment
* Plot the linear regression model over the previous scatter plot
